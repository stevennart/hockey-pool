                        <p>Federated Health Charities is one of the two workplace charitable campaigns of the Ontario Public Services
                        (OPS). For
                        over 37 years now the Federated Health Charities campaigns have raised over $49 million for Ontario’s major
                        health
                        charities through these campaigns to support 20+ health charities through payroll deductions, donations and
                        special
              events. This is an unprecedented achievement for a charity that exists within a single workplace.</p>

                        <p>Some of the notable charities include ALS Society of Canada, Alzheimer Society of Canada, Canadian Cancer
                        Society –
                        Ontario Chapter, Canadian Liver Foundation, Heart and Stroke, Osteoporosis Canada, etc. This year 3 new
                        charities are
              being welcomed: Autism Ontario, Parkinson Canada and MS Society of Canada.</p>


                        <p>A popular event in support of this charity campaign is this one, the Annual Federated Health Hockey Playoff
                        Pool. Over
                        the past 9 years, this event has raised over $7500 towards the cause. Thank you to poolies like all of you;
                        without your
              participation this event would not be such a great success!</p>


                        <p>This event has proven to be a fun-filled and exciting opportunity to claim bragging rights over your
                        colleagues. Each
                        year, the participation rate has increased, but not like it has in the past 3, where the participation rate
                        has
              increased by 50%.</p>

                        <p>Truly a great accomplishment by the Commissioners Nino Apostoli and Frank Verbari!</p>
